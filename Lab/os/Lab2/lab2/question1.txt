In this program, our objective is to create two child processes from the parent process and ensure 
the parent process terminates once the child process terminates. So, in our first step, we call a 
fork to see if we create the first child process. If the value is equal to 0, then we successfully 
created the first child and we print out their pid using getpid(), else if the value is greater than 
0 then we go to the parent process and create a second child process if the value is correct and 
print its pid. If not, then we utilize wait(0) to ensure the parent process does not terminate until 
the child processes do. Once they have finished, we can then terminate and print out that the child 
processes are done.
